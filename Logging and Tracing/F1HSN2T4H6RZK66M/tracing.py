    Trace events are a type of telemetry data (like log messages) that can capture when something has happened in the system or the application.
    Unlike log messages, trace events have a structured payload,
    which makes them a good choice for data analysis. For example,
    you can use trace events to capture some numbers that are calculated during the execution of your function,
    and analyze these numbers afterwards.
