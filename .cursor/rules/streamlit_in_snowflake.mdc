# Limitations and library changes [¶](mdc:https:/docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/limitations\#limitations-and-library-changes "Link to this heading")

This topic describes limitations and feature behavior changes when a Streamlit feature
works differently in Snowflake than in the open-source library.

## Unsupported Streamlit features [¶](mdc:https:/docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/limitations\#unsupported-streamlit-features "Link to this heading")

The following Streamlit features are not supported in Streamlit in Snowflake:

- [st.bokeh\_chart](mdc:https:/docs.streamlit.io/1.39.0/develop/api-reference/charts/st.bokeh_chart)

- [st.set\_page\_config](mdc:https:/docs.streamlit.io/1.39.0/develop/api-reference/configuration/st.set_page_config)


> The `page_title`, `page_icon`, and `menu_items` properties of the
> `st.set_page_config` command are not supported.

- [st.components.v1.iframe](mdc:https:/docs.streamlit.io/1.39.0/develop/api-reference/custom-components/st.components.v1.iframe)

- [st.components.v1.declare\_component](mdc:https:/docs.streamlit.io/1.39.0/develop/api-reference/custom-components/st.components.v1.declare_component)

## Limitations when loading external resources in Streamlit in Snowflake [¶](mdc:https:/docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/limitations\#limitations-when-loading-external-resources-in-sis "Link to this heading")

All Streamlit in Snowflake apps run within the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](mdc:https:/content-security-policy.com) that restricts which resources can be
loaded. Snowflake blocks loading code — including scripts, styles, fonts, and iframe embedding — from any external domain. However, loading a subset of resources from Mapbox is supported.

When you use the [st.map](mdc:https:/docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/charts/st.map) or
[st.pydeck\_chart](mdc:https:/docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/charts/st.pydeck_chart)
Streamlit commands, Mapbox provides the map tiles when rendering map content.
Mapbox is a third-party application and is subject to Snowflake’s
[External Offerings Terms](mdc:https:/www.snowflake.com/legal/external-offering-terms).

Loading images or media from external domains is supported in Streamlit in Snowflake, but not in the Snowflake Native App Framework.

For example, the following code runs without a Python error, but the script is not loaded or executed in the browser:

``
This will not work
import streamlit.components.v1 as components
components.html("""
<script src="http://www.example.com/example.js"></script>
""", height=0)
``

Copy

The CSP also blocks front-end calls that are generally considered unsafe, such as `eval()`.
